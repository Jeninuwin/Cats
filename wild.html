			<br></br><br></br>
			<center>
				The Black-Footed cat, also known as the smallest spotted cat in the world, is native to Nortern South Africa. 
				This cat thrives in open, dry savannas and shrubland, meaning places that contain a variety of heights for grass and low bush covers.
				The type of animals the Black-Footed preys on are: 
					<dt>Rodents</dt>
					<dt>Small birds</dt>
					<dt>Cape hare</dt>
				Becuase of how small the Black-Footed cat is, it has to resort to smaller prey. Despite it's small figure, they hunt in three ways.
					<dt>Fast hunt</dt>
					<dt>Slow hunt</dt>
					<dt>Sit and Wait hunt</dt>
				Depending on which mode it choses to hunt, results on how fast they move. Fast speed is from 2 to 3 km/h, slow speed is from 0.5 to 0.8 km/h, and sit and wait only depends on motionlessly waiting in front of the prey's den and closes it's eyes until they hear movement; that's when they attack.
